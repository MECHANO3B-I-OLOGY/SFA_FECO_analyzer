existing bugs to patch:

future plans:
  - do frame/pixel line/analysis
  - accept double waves
  - user picks frame, pick peaks of interest, analysis records x location of peaks from first frame to last frame for that/those peak(s)

finished:
  - ignore Y axis for point placement
    - bin across whole X
