existing bugs to patch:

future plans:

- calibration instructions, readme and in-ui
- unified file selection strategy, in and out (and finish error catching)
- scale window to screen (the right way?)

finished:

- get everything using matplotlib (KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE FOR BUGS)
- calibration wave selection (? hard to test)
- centerlines offset bug
- scale window to screen bug
- mica thickness value output in textbox
- ignore Y axis for point placement
  - bin across whole X
- user picks frame, pick peaks of interest, analysis records x location of peaks from first frame to last frame for that/those peak(s)
- do frame/pixel line/analysis
- accept double waves
- readme
- linear approximation and interpolation of turning point
- add option to split frame around turnaround
- add option to manually enter turnaround point
- use mercury calibration file to identify x coords of known wavelengths, extrapolate a translation of pixels to wavelength
